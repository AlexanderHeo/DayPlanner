User settings:{
    Transfer incompleted tasks to tomorrow
    keep me logged in (scenario : if user check keep me logged in (login screen or in him/her settings page) jwt will not has expires)
    User should has an option that make him/her daily routine (and this routine list will be in every day) (also user can select a list for just one day etc:Monday tasks list , ...)
    Auto categorize by tasks colors
}    

Bugs:{
    Homepage seems a moment when i redirect to dashboard page fix this (directly direct from index.js)
}

Improvements:{
    User should not go to back days from their registered date in daily view
    Check null inputs backend side (form validation in backend)
    Remove # form action, a href
    Make middleware Hashpass func
    Sortable list
    Mail verification
    Forgot my pass
}

Code quality:{
    apply destructing on your codes
    your server and your client should be different repos
    save your project from nested and useless if-else structures (in axios, mongoose)
    you can also use async-await alternative for then (then will be complicated your code for more than one queries)
