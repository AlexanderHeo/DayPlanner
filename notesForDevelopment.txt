Code quality:{
    apply destructing on your codes
    your server and your client should be different repos
    save your project from nested and useless if-else structures (in axios, mongoose)
    you can also use async-await alternative for then (then will be complicated your code for more than one queries)
    use import-export keyword with ESM (write modern JS)
